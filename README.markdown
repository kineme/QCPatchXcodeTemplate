This is the QCPatch Xcode Template, a.k.a. Quartz Composer unofficial API.

(In Apple's WWDC 2007 "Graphics and Media State of the Union" presentation, [an Apple engineer called Kineme's work "The Skanky SDK"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhXOPDqVYBE). In the past we've tried to _embrace their insult_, but nowadays we discourage using this terminology.)

Previous versions are [available from kineme.net](http://kineme.net/XcodeTemplateForCustomQuartzComposerPatches). 

Warning: This is a private API. Apple does not allow apps created using private APIs to be sold in the App Store.
